# Merchant Guide Application

This answers the 3rd question in the Coding Challenge


## Flow Chart

The Flow chart shows the execution Process from top to bottom for easy understanding
### Main Flow Chart
Main Execution flow

![main Flow Chart](src/main/resources/images/Merchant Guide-Merchant Guide Flow Chart.jpg)

The main flow chart contains 3 sub methods which I have included the flow charts as below

### ComputeIntergalacticDigits Flow Chart
![computeIntergalacticDigits](src/main/resources/images/Merchant Guide-computeIntergalaticDigits flow Chart.jpg)

### ComputeMetalCost Flow Chart

### ProcessQuestion Flow Chart

There are more algorithm in the codebase, for example the algorithm i came up with to convert Roman Digits to Integers, but that has been left out for brevity.

## Execution
This repository makes use of JDK 17 and maven 3.8.5

please make sure they are both in classpath
